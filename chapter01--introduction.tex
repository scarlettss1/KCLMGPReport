Our project aims to develop a dynamic and interactive habit tracking application that allows users to set and monitor personal and professional goals efficiently. By leveraging automation and data insights, the app will provide a seamless experience that minimises manual input, making habit tracking smarter and more intuitive. Users will also be able to gain valuable insights into their progress through clear visualisations (such as graphs and reports), helping them stay motivated and accountable.

The application is designed as a cross-platform system, primarily for iOS users while also being accessible via the web. The app has been developed using React Native with Expo Go, utilising TypeScript and JavaScript, and backend by a MySQL database. By combining user activity tracking and geo-information, the app is able to intelligently record activities.
