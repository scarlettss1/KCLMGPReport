\defaultInstructions

\begin{expectations}
A good introduction gives the reader a good idea of what the project is about in the shortest amount of text.  A reader should be able to get through this chapter very quickly and decide whether this project is relevant to their interests.
\begin{itemize}
\item A summary of the overriding business objective of the application.  Explain what the client, the end-users of your application, or the organisation deploying it would gain from the application.  Explain this value from the perspective of the client's or users' world, not from your perspective as a developer.   Do not list features, requirements, or specifications here.  The software is a means to an end, not the objective in itself.
\item A statement of the type of system you built, including the platforms on which it can be used, and the technology stack used to build it.
\end{itemize}
This chapter does not require any sections of subsections.  In many projects, two short paragraphs will be enough.  However, you can use more if the objective cannot be explained in a single paragraph.  Note, though, that you will be developing the objectives further in the next chapter.
\end{expectations}

\begin{length}
A single page should be sufficient for this chapter.  More than two pages is too long.
