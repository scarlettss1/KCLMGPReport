\chapter{Objectives and stakeholders}

\section{Project objectives}
\label{sect:objectives}
The main objective of this project is to create a flexible, user-friendly habit and activity tracking app that helps people monitor and improve their productivity in a simple, yet customisable way. 

The value our system provides to the stakeholders includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Better Productivity:} Users can easily track their habits and activities without too much manual input, helping them stay on top of their goals.
    
    \item \textbf{Smart Tracking:} Using location data, mobile activity, app usage, and AI, the app will automatically recognise what users are doing based on the information provided.

    \item \textbf{Customisable Habit Tracking:} Users can define habits in their own way, making the system more flexible and suited to different productivity styles. Most habit trackers enforce strict schedules, marking habits as "failed" if missed. Our app offers a flexible approach, letting users set goals like "exercise 3 times a week," dynamically adjusting streaks and sending only a weekly reminder to reduce pressure.

    \item \textbf{Privacy and Control:} Users will have full control over their data, with options to grant permissions, delete data, and choose which apps are tracked.

    \item \textbf{Data Insights:} The app will offer user-friendly, customisable graphs and reports to help users analyse their progress and export this data if needed. This allows users to assess their progress over a period of time, which can be a powerful tool to see where improvements towards their goals can be made in the future.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stakeholder}
\label{sect:stakeholder}

\subsection{Stakeholder analysis}
We have identified each stakeholder group, ensuring that our project delivers meaningful value while also addressing the potential risks and challenges associated with it.

Using the D.A.N.C.E. framework, the key stakeholder groups include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Decisions:} Stakeholders who decide constraints, shape the project direction, and provide guidance. This includes academic supervisors and the development team (university students).

    \item \textbf{Authority:} Stakeholders who must grant permission for the project. This includes academic supervisors who oversee the project, university administration that imposes policies on student projects, App Store regulators for deployment, and data protection authorities for handling user data.

    \item \textbf{Need:} Stakeholders impacted by the system. This includes the primary users such as students, professionals, and individuals most likely above the age of 13 looking to improve their productivity.

    \item \textbf{Connections:} People who can remove obstacles or enable success. This includes the development team, more specifically, front-end developers using TypeScript and JavaScript, and back-end developers managing the MySQL database.

    \item \textbf{Energy:} Stakeholders who influence enthusiasm or skepticism for the project. These include the development team, test users, users, and academic supervisors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key stakeholders}
The key stakeholders are those who determine how successful this project has been. By identifying them, we can make sure that each group's needs and contraints are considered, allowing for a more effective development process.

Key stakeholders we have identified:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primary Users:} The individuals who will interact with the application daily to track their habits and productivity. They include students, professionals, and individuals above the age of 13 looking to improve their time management and personal growth.

    \item \textbf{Development Team:} The university students responsible for planning, designing, building, and deploying the software. We must ensure the app is functional, includes thorough testing, and is compliant with academic, ethical, and legal standards.

    \item \textbf{Academic Supervisors and Project Proposers:} Professors and researchers who initiated the project and will provide mentorship, assessment, and guidance throughout the development process.

    \item \textbf{Privacy Regulators:} Given the applicationâ€™s reliance on personal data, privacy regulators will play a role in shaping how data is collected, stored, and managed.

    \item \textbf{Technology Providers:} Third-party service providers that allow us to develop and deploy the application. This includes React Native and Expo Go for mobile and web development, MySQL database hosting services, security services for data encryption, user authentication, and privacy compliance, and finally, technologies that allow user activity tracking (for example, using location-based data).
\end{itemize}
