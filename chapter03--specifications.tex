\defaultInstructions

\begin{length}
There are no strict length requirements for this chapter.  However, it is important that the writing is clear and concise.  Avoid repeating yourself.  It is expected that a typical project needs 1--5 pages, but this can vary considerably from project to project.
\end{length}

\begin{expectations}
This chapter should provide the specifications of the software that you have implemented.  Good specifications are clear, concise, consistent (with one another and with the project objectives), estimable (the effort required of functional requirements should be estimable), and testable (you should be able to create automated or manual tests for these specifications).

A significant part of this chapter covers functional requirements/specifications.  These refer to the product features your team has developed.  Present a clear overview of all functional requirements/specifications that can be found in the deployed system.  For each feature, explain how it contributes to the project objectives, and explain how/where it can be found.  Do \emph{not} mix the specifications the team managed to implement with those they did not.  

If necessary or helpful for clarity, explain what is out of scope of the project in a distinct section.  You may discuss ideas for functional specifications the team did not manage to implement, provided this discussion is clearly distinct from the project's achieved functional specifications.

The project objectives will also entail certain non-functional specifications.  These may include, for example, reliability, usability, portability, scalability, performance, compatibility, security, compliance, etc.  Identify which non-functional specifications are important to this project and define them.  Make sure to present them in order of importance, and relate each one to the project objectives.  

The section headers below provide a suggested structure.  You should feel free to change it or extend it.

\section{Functional specifications}
\label{sect:functional-specifications}
The following features have been developed and are accessible in the deployed application. Each contributes directly to the project's objectives of creating a flexible, user-friendly application that can enhance the user's productivity.

\subsection{User Authentication and Authorization}
\textbf{Description:} Users can register and log in and will be restricted to visit and pages in the app while no logged in. 

\textbf{Contribution to Objectives:} This ensures secure access to the system and will allow the user to create and save habits which is essential in the applications functionality. It will also allow the user to access their account on any device.

\textbf{Location:} When the application is first opened you will be greeted with the login page. If you don't already have an account you and switch to the sign-in page to create one. If you try to access any other pages when you are not logged in you will be redirected to the login page.

\subsection{Habit Creation and Management}
\textbf{Description:} Interface for users to add new habits with customization fields.

\textbf{Contribution to Objectives:} The user will have customisable habit tracking as they can choose between creating a 'build' habit (developing new behaviours) or a 'quit' habit (breaking bad habits). They can set the goal value of the habit and the units that the habit uses. They can also visually customise the habit by selecting the colour of the habit. After the habit is created the user can edit the habit in anyway they like so that they don't have to delete it and create a new one.

\textbf{Location:} All of the habit creation and management will be found on the habits page which is the first page that shows when the user logs-in to the app.
