\defaultInstructions

\begin{instructions}
By default, this chapter is not included in the report because most teams do \emph{not} need this chapter.  If your project requires this chapter, uncomment the \texttt{input} command that includes this chapter.
\end{instructions}

\begin{expectations}
If your project includes training a machine learning model, and you made an effort to evaluate alternative  approaches, teams should include this chapter discussing the machine learning work.  It is recommended to  include a short summary description for each considered approach, a clear description and rationale of the  approach taken to evaluate and compare the different algorithms, a table summarising the results obtained in evaluation, and your team's decision on what algorithm was chosen for incorporation in the system.  Also  explain how the team's results can be replicated.  This chapter is not required if an existing machine learning model or tool was used, or if the team did not evaluate the machine learning component.
